# Personal-Flight-Logbook
A website to view a map of completed flights, an analytics page to view statistics based on your flights, and a hub where you can view, filter, add, or remove flights.

This project was to get an intro to web development and to practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript but mainly focusing on the backend with Javascript. I wanted to also have a project where I could combine it with my interest in aviation so I decided to create a Personal Flight Tracker/Logbook. My goals are to create a page using the Google Maps API to visualize all the flights completed, having a page where I can see the list of flights and have an option to add, remove and filter flights, and an analytics page to show statistics based on all the flights data. I self learned all languages using Codecademy to practice.
